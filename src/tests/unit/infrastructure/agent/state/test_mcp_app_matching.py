"""Tests for MCPApp ID matching logic.

This test file follows TDD methodology:
1. Write failing test first (RED)
2. Implement minimal code to pass (GREEN)
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing (REFACTOR)

The tests verify that MCPApp matching is robust and provides detailed
debugging information when matches fail.
