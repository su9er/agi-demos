"""Canonical metadata key constants for workspace autonomy.

Historically these keys were scattered as magic strings across
``workspace_goal_runtime``, ``worker_report/``, ``adjudicator/`` and the
dispatcher — 30+ references with subtle typos and inconsistent casing. This
module centralizes them so:

* typos become import errors,
* renames become single-point changes,
* readers can discover the vocabulary by importing this module.

Conventions
-----------
* **Writers** SHOULD import from this module (e.g. ``metadata[KEY] = ...``).
* **Readers** MAY continue using bare string literals in hot loops for now;
  migration is incremental. New code MUST use the constants.
* All keys are ``Final[str]`` so mypy/pyright refuses ``=`` to a Literal mismatch.

The string values must never change without a matching data migration —
existing persisted ``WorkspaceTask.metadata`` payloads already contain them.
